## The Project

The idea for a portfolio is well known. I wanted a site of my own on the big world wide web to showcase the projects I've done (and those that are to come). However I wanted to get something else out of building a portfolio.

I wanted to experiment and learn about several technologies with this side project (ES6, Flex and Grunt mainly). Thus, from the beginning I forbide myself to use any framework. The
use of jQuery/Bootstrap/Vue.js/Angularjs... was not allow for the development. Moreover, the page was going to be so simple that I thought it was really unnecessary to make my visitors download any extra KB.

## Project organization

On my current company, I've been using agile development methodologies. We do the whole Scrum thing. Planning, development based on user's stories and
3 week long sprints. I have to confess that I'm a fan of agile development, for the good organization on the current projects I've been experiencing. This made me decide
to adopt some of the Scrum principles for this side-project. Of course is a very simplistic version, so simplistic that maybe I shouldn't even call
it Scrum üòÖ.

During the development of the page I've been using a Trello board with 5 lists that I'll explain in some detail:

* To Do
* In Progress
* On Hold
* Done
* Discarded

### To Do List

This is a **prioritized** list with all the [User's Stories](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories) wanted on my portfolio. The word 
*prioritized* is stressed for a reason. I've discovered on my daily work that using a prioritized list has a huge impact on your productivity.

First, it allows you to not having to worry about what to pick up next when you're done with your current task. Just take the following one at the top of the list

Have you ever been developing when suddenly a great idea for a new impleentation just spawned in your mind? I have, and before a blink of an eye, I find myself developing that new idea letting my current task unfinished. And it can happen a fair amount of times.

If this has been your case as well, maybe this list can help. Its second advantage is it avoids to get distracted with those new cool feature you've just came up with. Instead, that idea  goes at the bottom of the *To do list*, and it will be adressed eventually.

### In Progress

This is one of those lists that is much more usefull when working with a team. With it I can see which User's Stories are already being developed right now, getting those stories out of the *To do list*. However, as I've been a single developer while programming my portfolio, there wasn't going to be any story that I didn't pulled out myself from the *To do list*.

Thus this list was never going to be bigger than one item long. However I kept the list for familiarity, and because it feels great to move a story to *In progress*. Besides, it quickly tells you what you've been into the last session and fosters the hyper-focus single-task mindset. This last feature was something I discovered while using the list, rather than a reason for making the list itself. But was a pleasant discovery anyhow üòÅ.

### On Hold

I think none of the user's stories hit this list in the whole development. The list is intended for those user's story that have been started but that for some reason you can't move them to the *Done list*. In my experience, the main reasons for keeping a User's story *On Hold* are

* You're blocked for some other User's Story that has to be finished before.
* There's something you unclear about the User's Story and you have to ask and wait until the client clarifies it

However, as there wasn't anyone else but me doing this, I've never done two User's Stories at once (Very unlikely even if I wanted ü§î). So, having prioritized properly the *To Do list* there's no reason why a User's Story should block me And since it was a personal project, whatever the doubt about a User's story was, I answered myself üòÇ.

### Done

The last resort for any of your User's Story. The purpose of this list is cristal clear, isn't it? Any finished User's Story will jump from *In Progress* to *Done*. There's no magic in this list.

Yet, There's one recomendation I'd give to you. I like to have at the top of the list the most recent completed User's Story. This way I can quickly see the last completed tasks, giving me more context on how the project is going, more than just with the *In Progress* list, at least.

### Discarded

It happened to me a couple of times that, after starting a User's Story, I see no use on it. The feature was going to be useless, or just not worth the time. On these cases, instead of archiving, I put them into this list. There's no much use on this list either, however I like to see the things I've discarded rather than hidding them. Personal preference, I suppose.

## Making and tracking progress

Currently I'm hired as a full-time web developer, which is great for so many reason üòä but not that great in terms of letting you spare time for side projects and personal development üòì. Despite of this fact, I managed to consistently devote 1 hour to this project every day after work. And despite the lack of free time, I managed to gather about 41 hours of work in 2 months.

I've been able to give you the exact amount of time because I've tracked every minute focused on building the project using *Toggl*. This has worked great for me, far better than I expected.

First, tracking is a motivational burst as I can see every week that I'm really moving forward. Then, the fact of clicking the timmer start button helps on reaching the hyper-focused state of mind. And last but not least, mixing a tracking system with pomodoro timers (something that Toggle does out of the box) has also proved to have a good impact on me, in these years (I procrastinate less, having a full session is less tough, and also helps to be focused on a 25 minutes long time lapse).

Well, I think I've talked enough about meta-work. Let's dive into what really matters, the project itself.
