The last Saturday(24-01-2016) most of the more active members in freeCodeCamp spanish chat met troughout Google Hangouts, and I really loved the experience.

Maybe you're thinking, what's this guy talking about, freeCodeCamp? Let me do a short explanation. [freeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/) (FCC for short) is a really nice web platform where people all over the world are learning web development. More specifically, the campers (that's the name for the users of FCC) learn full stack web developmente based on JavaScript. However, there's no such a big deal a platform where learn to code. Which is really amazing with FCC is the hige comunity gathered.

Thanks to this big community, FCC has been able to set up some really acive chat rooms, where people go to ask for help when they're stuck in some of the FCC challenges, other issues related with programming or even some little chat. In my case, I'm pretty active in the spanish chat room which gathers people from spain and latino am√©rica. I've ended up talking with my fellows campers every day, at least to say 'good morning' =).

Besides the chat rooms, FCC promotes the creation for local groups, better know as [campsites](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/Campsites). They are meetup groups for people near geographically for taking a coffee and coding toguether. When I first hear about this I loved the idea. I'd read and heard from very popular programmers (e.g.[Scott Hanselman](https://twitter.com/shanselman?lang=es) and [Sharon](https://twitter.com/saronyitbarek?lang=es)) about the importance of going to meetups like this. Thus, I wanted to give it a try and created the [FCC Valencia Local Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/free.code.camp.vlc/?ref=bookmarks).

Unfortunatelly, it seems that there wasn't to many people from Valencia aware of the existance of FCC and of course about the Valencia group. So, even though I've been trying it for a few months, I haven't been able to organize a meetup. It's a pitty.

Nevertheless, one day at the spanish chat room, I don't know how the idea came up but we started to talk about the possibility of meeting through Google Hangouts, emulating that we were like a local group. The main difficulty we had was the different timezones of our members, if we wanted to be Spain and "America Latina" we had to deal with differences up to 6 hours. So, we met at sunday [00:00 (GMT +1)](http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/time-zone/gmt-plus-1/). A bit late for the europeans, but we were all willing to talk to each other with our own voices, at least once, and so we did.

We talked about lots of topics, but we kept most of the time talking about ourselves to know better each other. Things like name, age, location, what have we done before FCC, how did we find about FCC and what we were planing to do with the adquired skills. Later, the conversation derived to talk about education, opinions about the current popularity of JavaScript... even I had the chance to talk a little about Python which I love for being my programing mother language =).

It has been a great experience, indeed. And the next time will be even better. We have the idea of starting little coding competitions in the future events using websites such as project euler, codecademy, codecombats and so on. Anyway, if you have any suggestions about things a local group can do, we're open to suggestions.

If you want to join us enter to the [spanish chatroom](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/Espanol) and we'll be glad to welcome you ;).
